# Green-minds-Freelancer

In this project, we aim to build a platform for two categories of users: 1) freelancers who have specific skills to do a task, a project, or a job, and 2) employers who want their tasks and projects to be done or their empty positions to be filled. Our platform will connect these two and introduces freelancers and professionals to employers with specific demands. Consequently, employers can browse workers and connect with those who are capable of providing the desired service and hire them, and also freelancers can search for tasks in line with their skills and abilities. 

This web application is implemented by Django and HTML, CSS and Javascript for the front-end.
